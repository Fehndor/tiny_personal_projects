# tiny_personal_projects

Small one‑ or two‑script utilities I've built to make my life and
workflow a little easier. They're trivial on their own, which is why
they don't (yet) deserve their own separate repos.

Each directory contains a self‑contained project and includes its own
README explaining purpose and usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📁 What's in here

-   A set of independent script‑folders\
-   Each folder has its own README describing:
    -   what it does\
    -   how to run it\
    -   any dependencies\
-   No overarching architecture or framework --- just simple tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How to use

1.  Browse to the folder for the tool you're interested in.\

2.  Read its README to understand its purpose and usage.\

3.  Clone or download the repo if you'd like to try out one of the
    scripts:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fehndor/tiny_personal_projects.git
    ```

4.  Navigate into the desired tool directory and follow the
    instructions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧰 Why this repo

-   Keeps all my small utilities in one place.\
-   Avoids cluttering the main "serious" repos with throw‑away scripts.\
-   Makes it easy to share, reuse or adapt the scripts when needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🤝 Contributing

If you find a script here useful and want to improve it, feel free to
open a Pull Request. Since each tool is lightweight, please:

-   Keep changes minimal and focused.\
-   Update the tool's README if you add new functionality.\
-   Consider whether the change truly belongs in this repo (vs. a
    dedicated repo for a larger project).

## 📝 Licensing

This repo is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for
full terms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Future Plans

-   As a script grows in complexity or scope, it may be split into its
    own repo.\
-   I'll keep adding new small utilities here as I come across workflow
    pain points.

Thanks for checking this out!\
If you use anything here, I'd love to hear how you adapted it (or how it
could be improved).
